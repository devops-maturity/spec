# How to Contribute

## Repo Layout

We use [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) as static site generator, so we use the [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) HUGO proposes.

#### Our implementation

* `./content`: contains all the versions of the specification.
* `./content/next/`: contains the version of the specification (where all the changes SHOULD be made).
* `./content/../index.[lang].md`: contains the content of the specification, if a language is specified it's a translation.

## Contributing

We'd love your help to suggest improvements to the specification, fixing typos, or adding more translations. Please don't hesitate to send a pull request.

### Adding a translation

1. Create a new file in `./content/version/index.[lang].md` using the hugo command `hugo new [version]/index.[lang].md`.
1. Ensure all files have the appropriate fields required (see others as an example)..
1. Add the language to the `config.yaml` file (see others as an example).

### Running project locally

There's a docker-compose.yml file ready that will help you to check if the website looks good!
To run it make sure you have [docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) on your machine and just use the command `docker-compose up` to make it run locally.

or you can run `make all-dev` to run the project locally.

Once the website will be compiled, you can see the website visiting `http://localhost:1313`

## Pull Requests

DevOps Maturity Specification use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork the spec repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## License

You must agree that your patch will be licensed under the DevOps Maturity Specification License, and when we change the license we will assume that you agreed with the change unless you object to the changes in time.
